**Intuition**

The code aims to generate all possible combinations of `k` elements from a set of `n` elements.  Think of it like choosing a team of `k` players from a group of `n` players.

**Approach**

1. **Initialization:**
   - A list `ans` is created to store the initial set of `n` elements (from 1 to `n`).
   - This list will be used as the input for the `combinations` function.

2. **Generating Combinations:**
   - The code calls the `combinations` function (presumably from the `itertools` library) with the `ans` list and `k` as arguments.
   - The `combinations` function is responsible for generating all possible combinations of `k` elements from the input list.

**Complexity**

* **Time Complexity:** The `combinations` function from `itertools` has a time complexity of O(nCk), where nCk represents the binomial coefficient (number of ways to choose `k` elements from `n`). This is because it needs to generate all possible combinations.
* **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also O(nCk) as it needs to store all the generated combinations.
